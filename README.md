# Blockchain Web Application

This project is a full-stack web application that includes a blockchain backend and a React.js frontend. The application allows users to interact with a blockchain and make transactions.

## Technologies Used

This project uses the following technologies:

- MongoDB
- Express.js
- React
- Node.js

## Test-Driven Development

This project was built using test-driven development. Tests were written before the code was implemented, to ensure that the application was functioning correctly.

## Blockchain Implementation

The blockchain was implemented using object-oriented programming principles. It includes a proof-of-work algorithm, and transactions are signed using cryptography and digital signatures. There is also a transaction pool for incoming data.

## Frontend Application

The frontend of the application was built using React.js. Users can view the blockchain and make transactions.

## Deployment

The application is deployed to production using multiple servers to ensure reliability and availability.

## API

An API was created to allow other applications to interact with the blockchain.

## Peer-to-Peer Server

The application includes a real-time connected peer-to-peer server with a pub/sub implementation. This allows for efficient communication between nodes on the network.

## Test Suite

A full test suite was created to ensure that the application is functioning correctly.

## Getting Started

To run the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`
3. Start the server using `npm run dev`
4. Start the peer-to-peer server using `npm run dev-peer`
5. Start the frontend using `npm start` (in a separate terminal window)
6. Open the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`
